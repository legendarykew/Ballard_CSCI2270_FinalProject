# Ballard_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

Project: Dynamic Structure Generator

  The concept of this project is to provide a solution to the problem that not every application requires a "vanilla" data structure: perhaps a single queue, or a BST, isn't enough to satisfy what one's trying to do. Of course, with every issue in CS, a solution can be made in the project -- but a general means of quickly creating and initializing more complex and interwoven data structures would make matters easier. So, that's what Dynamic Structure Generator (DSG) aims to do: provide a simple means of creating, initializing and interacting with more complex data structures, like binary search trees of queues, or a stack of hash tables.
